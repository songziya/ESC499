### \<Issue Encountered\>
[Sep 16]: \*\*\* No plan.py file in the either of the folder PROST_ROOT or RDDLSIM_ROOT (not able to run client)

\* Error when entering `vagrant up`. (It is unknown if this will affect future exercise yet)

[Sep 15]: \* Current wildfire_mdp.rddl file is different from the sample code in Tutorial. (But it's still functional)
