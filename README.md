This repository is dedicated to my graduation thesis. It contains all the files that are related to the thesis. 

A detailed plan will be gradually developed below throughout the semester, and I'll be posting progress update in a weekly basis. 

### Work Plan
1. Learning RDDL Tutorial
2.
3.

###  \*\*Updates & Progress\*\*
[Sep 14 16:00-18:00]: Learning git command lines.

&emsp; Useful link: [Git command cheetsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

[Sep 15 11:30-16:00 17:30-19:00]: Learning RDDL Tutorial to section 2.7.1, Ran wildfire_mdp in cmd with visualizer.

&emsp; Useful link: [RDDL language description](https://sites.google.com/site/rddltutorial/rddl-language-discription)

&emsp; Syntax debugging: `./run rddl.parser.parser <PATH/FILENAME>`

&emsp; Simulation running: `./run rddl.sim.Simulator <DOMAINPATH> <rddl-policy> <inst-name> <viz-class-name>`

[Sep 16 19:00-24:00]: Setup PROST with VirtualBox, able to establish server. Complete the tutorial.

### \<Issue Encountered\>
[Sep 15]: \* Current wildfire_mdp.rddl file is different from the sample code in Tutorial. (But it's still functional)

[Sep 16]: \*\*\* No plan.py file in the either of the folder PROST_ROOT or RDDLSIM_ROOT (not able to run client)

\* Error when entering `vagrant up`. (It is unknown if this will affect future exercise yet)
